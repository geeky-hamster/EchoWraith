# Contributing to Infidelity

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Infidelity as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the project's style guidelines
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Document your code
- Write clean, readable code

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Documentation

- Update the README.md if needed
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update the CHANGELOG.md for significant changes
- Keep API documentation current
